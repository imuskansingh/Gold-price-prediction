Objective:
The project aimed to predict the future price of gold using machine learning models based on historical data and various economic indicators.

Key Highlights:

Data Collection & Preprocessing:
Gathered historical gold price data and relevant economic factors such as exchange rates, stock market indices, and inflation rates. Cleaned and prepared the dataset for analysis using Python (pandas, NumPy).

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Conducted in-depth EDA using Matplotlib and Seaborn to identify trends, correlations, and patterns in the data.

Machine Learning Implementation:

Built and trained models using Linear Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.
Performed feature engineering to improve the modelâ€™s performance by selecting relevant predictors.
Model Evaluation:
Evaluated models based on metrics like R-squared, Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). Optimized the best-performing model for higher accuracy.

Results:
Achieved a reliable prediction model for forecasting gold prices, providing valuable insights for financial decision-making and investment strategies.

Tools Used:
Python (pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn), Scikit-learn, and Jupyter Notebook.

Outcome:
The project showcased my ability to work with real-world data, apply machine learning techniques, and deliver actionable insights through predictive modeling.
